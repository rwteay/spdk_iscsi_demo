  Provision a guest using bootimg and xNVMe source

  The guest is created based of the "bootimg" in the config.

  On "local" the folder "/tmp/artifacts", must contain

  * xnvme-src.tar.gz
  * xnvme-py-sdist.tar.gz

  These will be transferred to the guest, and unpacked in "/tmp/xnvme_source", then built and
  installed.
