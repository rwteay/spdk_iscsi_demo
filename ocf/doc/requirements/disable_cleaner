Disabling cleaner is a feature that is intented to be used with read cache
(Write-Thourgh and Write-Around modes), where no dirty data is produced, so
the cleaning is not necessary. Its major benefit is metadata memory footprint
reduction, which is result of not allocating "cleaning" metatada section,
that constitutes about 20% of total metadata capacity.

While it is possible to use disable_cleaner option Write-Back and Write-Only
modes, it may result in performance degradation due to necessity to perform
cleaning on eviction.
